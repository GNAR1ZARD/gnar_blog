### Network Hardening for Security

To protect against various security threats, several measures were implemented to harden the network and systems:

1. **Firewall Deployment**:
   - The FortiGate firewall filters incoming and outgoing traffic, blocking unauthorized access and mitigating threats such as DDoS attacks.
2. **Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS)**:
   - Integrated IDPS within the firewall and core switch to detect and respond to malicious activities in real-time.
3. **VLAN Segmentation**:
   - Departmental VLANs prevent lateral movement of threats within the network, isolating sensitive data and limiting access based on departmental roles.
4. **Access Control Lists (ACL)**:
   - Configured ACLs on the Layer 3 switches to control the flow of traffic and restrict access to critical resources.
5. **Regular Security Audits and Updates**:
   - Scheduled security audits and routine updates to firmware and software to address vulnerabilities and enhance protection.

### Ensuring Network Reliability and Redundancy

To ensure continuous operation and minimize downtime, the following measures are implemented:

- **Redundant Hardware**: Spare switches and firewalls are available for quick deployment in case of failure.
- **Redundant Connections**: Critical network devices are connected using multiple network paths to ensure redundancy.
- **Redundant Power Supplies**: UPS units provide backup power, ensuring network stability during power outages.
- **Cloud Services**: GCPâ€™s high availability guarantees reduce the risk.
